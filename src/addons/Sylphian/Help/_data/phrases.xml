This community is built as a safe, supportive, and inclusive space for LGBTQ+ individuals and allies. All users are required to follow the rules below without exception. Failure to comply may result in account restrictions, suspension, or a permanent ban, depending on the nature of the violation. These rules apply to all public and private areas of the forum, including DMs.</p>

			<h3>1. Zero Tolerance for Disrespect</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Harassment, insults, threats, or personal attacks are not allowed under any circumstances.</li>
				<li>Misgendering, deadnaming, or ignoring someone’s stated pronouns is not permitted.</li>
				<li>If you cannot engage respectfully, do not engage at all.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>2. No Discrimination</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Any form of bigotry is strictly prohibited. This includes but is not limited to: racism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, ableism, ageism, or misogyny.</li>
				<li>This is an LGBTQ+ affirming space. If you hold views in conflict with that, this forum is not for you.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>3. Content Warnings Are Required</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Posts discussing sensitive topics such as abuse, trauma, self-harm, or violence must include a content warning at the beginning.</li>
				<li>Use spoiler tags appropriately to hide sensitive or potentially triggering content.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>4. Illegal Activity is Forbidden</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Do not share or link to pirated content, illegal downloads, or instructions for committing illegal acts.</li>
				<li>Doxxing — sharing any private or identifying information about another person — is an instant, permanent ban.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>5. No Spam or Unapproved Promotion</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Spamming, bot activity, or mass-advertising will result in immediate suspension.</li>
				<li>You may share personal projects only in designated sections and only if they are relevant to the discussion.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>6. Moderator Decisions Are Final</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>If a moderator issues a directive, you are expected to follow it immediately.</li>
				<li>Publicly arguing with staff, mini-modding, or undermining moderation will result in disciplinary action.</li>
				<li>Appeals can be made privately through the proper channels — not in public threads.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>7. One Account Per Person</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Each user is allowed one account. Creating multiple accounts without prior staff approval is prohibited.</li>
				<li>Ban evasion — creating a new account to bypass a ban — results in a permanent ban on all accounts.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>8. Privacy is Non-Negotiable</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Do not request or share anyone's real name, location, social media, or private photos — even if they posted it elsewhere.</li>
				<li>Outing a user’s LGBTQ+ identity, legal name, or other private information without their explicit consent will result in an instant and permanent ban. No exceptions.</li>
			</ul>

			<hr>

			<h3>Reporting Violations</h3>
			<p>If you witness or experience any rule violations, use the <strong>report</strong> button or contact staff immediately. Reports are confidential and taken seriously. Do not engage with the violator directly.</p>
